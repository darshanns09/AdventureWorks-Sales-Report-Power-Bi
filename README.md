# AdventureWorks-Sales-Report-Power-Bi
POWER BI PROJECT


## Overview of Adventure Works sales data - 

In AdventureWorks project, I have done work through the entire business intelligence workflow: connecting and shaping the data, building a relational model, adding calculated fields, and designing an interactive report.

The AdventureWorks project is a comprehensive business intelligence (BI) initiative that involves various stages and tasks aimed at leveraging data to gain valuable insights into a fictional company's operations.

The primary objective of this project is to extract meaningful insights from the company's data to support informed decision-making and enhance business performance.

The Adventure Works project aimed to provide a comprehensive view of the company's performance over the years, including revenue growth, outlier detection, and insights into factors affecting sales. This data-driven approach supports informed decision-making and enhances business performance by leveraging the power of business intelligence tools like Power BI.



## Data preparation and loading -

1. Data Collection - Gathering relevant sales data from multiple sources while ensuring accuracy and completeness is a foundational step in any data-driven business intelligence or analysis project
2. Data cleaning - Data cleaning and transformation are essential steps in the data preparation process, ensuring that the data used for analysis is accurate and free from inconsistencies. This involves 
                   addressing missing values through imputation or deletion, removing duplicate records, standardizing data formats for consistency, handling outliers appropriately, and converting data types as 
                   needed. 
3. Data Modeling - A robust data model serves as the foundation for effective reporting and analysis by organizing data, ensuring data integrity, optimizing data retrieval, and providing a structured framework 
                   that supports the changing needs of the organization. It enhances data quality, consistency, and security while empowering users to derive meaningful insights and make informed decisions based 
                   on trustworthy data.
